The project supports inter- and intra- generational cohabitation as an integrated solution to tackle different kinds of social problems. This project offers an innovative and sustainable solution to older people in need of help for household maintenance and household keeping, families in need to reconcile family and work life as well as to persons experiencing economic difficulties who are in need of an affordable and decent accommodation and to women who are victims of domestic violence and in need of a temporary shelter.\n\nSocial workers, public authorities and volunteers work together to provide tailor-made housing solutions as well as support and protection (through ad hoc legal tools) to users in all stages of the cohabitation. The project facilitates the creation of interpersonal relationships and promotes the value of solidarity between generations as a way to empower people, actively participate in society and combat isolation. Moreover, Abitare Solidale is environment-friendly and highly sustainable: it is based on the optimisation of the existing housing stock and it represents an alternative to retirement houses which are not sustainable on a long-term for structural and environmental reasons.\n\nThe project represents a solution to cope with the problem of isolation and social exclusion of older persons. It allows older people to stay longer in their homes improving their active participation in society, independent living and self-determination. It represents a solution to the decreasing availability of informal care givers (women, family networks) and an alternative to retirement houses.\n\nThe project helps people in need to find an affordable and decent accommodation allowing them to actively participate in society. It offers an innovative solution to new causes of poverty and social exclusion: precarious jobs, migration, people not entitled to public protection schemes and/or to public care services. Through the idea of mutual aid, the project represents an alternative to isolation and stigmatisation of people facing economical or personal difficulties and provides them a concrete support to be (re)integrated in society."

Ithaka, striving for quality of life for all, supported freedom through empowerment and process inclusion. Inclusion is more than being able to take part in activities, but is taking up meaningful roles in society as an employee, a participant, a tourist, a citizen, a family member.

In a nutshell, CIL piloted, tested, researched, analyzed, mainstreamed, standardized and accredited the personal  assistance (PA) service with the relevant institutions of the national government.\n\nCIL is an NGO that was founded in 1996 on cross-disability principle www.cilsrbija.org. Inspired by the Irish experience, CIL introduced a pilot PA project in Serbia in the year 2000. The project was funded by Irish Aid. It took 12 years from that initial personal assistance service project to the accredited service. In the process, CIL took all the steps that are normally done by the government in cooperation with the expert community prior to the introduction of a new social service:\n\n• Designed and implemented a feasibility study for the PA service\n\n• Designed and implemented a cost-effectiveness study for the PA service\n\n• Designed and implemented a participatory action research on PA service\n\n• Produced two films by service users in order to raise awareness\n\n• Designed and successfully advocated for mainstreaming of PA service standards for Serbia\n\n• Advocated for modernization of the law on Social Protection that now includes PA as a service option\n\n• Designed, tested and accredited training curriculum for PA service providers\n\n• Trained service providers and service users in order to implement the standard\n\n• Raised awareness of local self-governments on the new social service and standards of implementation\n\nOnce the PA service was mainstreamed, i.e. included in the law as a possibility but not a mandatory option, it became eligible for public funding, mostly at the local level. However, there were no monitoring  mechanisms in place to ensure integrity of the service. As a result, some contractors sold modified day care as PA services to local self governments. In order to protect service users as well as service providers, CIL went through a procedurally demanding and complex process of curriculum design and accreditation with the National Social Welfare Institute. As the accredited training provider on PA service, CIL can now support the implementation of the standard of service. Ultimately, this leads to a better quality of service. Training can be commissioned by any organization/individual. PAs and service users have easy access to quality training at all times.\n\nThis accredited service is innovative because it is designed and provided by persons with disabilities who are service users themselves, trainers, managers of the service and soft monitors of implementation of the national standard. Service users are empowered and they actively participate in maintaining the integrity of the service. The accreditation has contributed to spreading the philosophy of independent living and supporting sustainability of CIL. Through this process, CIL became a policy player. The independent living movement in the region gained a strong ally and people with disabilities in Serbia have access to a new social service that would not have been available without the initiative and persuasive commitment of CIL that was ready to embrace new roles and engage other stakeholders in new relationships."

The organization is most effective in reaching the 'hard-to-reach’ target groups that alternative providers have missed to address (single parents, parents with immigrant background, etc.).\n\nIt has designed a coaching program that fundamentally builds on the interests, the involvement and the capabilities of the parents, which decide individually and freely on their participation (empowerment). By applying a bottom-up, low-threshold approach the organization succeeds in building trust in participants that enables intense and effective collaboration. The approach integrates the current findings of neuroscience, developmental psychology and social education and is being evaluated constantly on a scientific basis.\n\nThe intervention is highly preventative, since it helps avoiding the emergence of family problems before they occur. Thereby it ensures a conflict-free upraising and education of the children. This is important, since early childhood and youth experiences have a high impact on the future development of people. Furthermore, the program is conceptualized for small groups in local neighborhoods. Thereby it automatically enables the establishment of mutual aid and community networks that mostly continue to exist after the end of the official program.\n\nThe effectiveness of the intervention is underlined by the fact that an increasing number of well established, large Welfare organizations have started making use of the experiences and the special concept of Eltern AG and let their staff participate in vocational trainings provided by the organization. Eltern AG thereby serves as an innovative lever for the existing welfare landscape."

The 8 Basic European Social Care Learning Outcomes (BESCLO) have been shown to reliably cover this essential knowledge and the ECC Board has established an exam (paper or online) to test for knowledge of these outcomes.\n\nThis began because there was no common statement of what staff needed to know to begin working within the care sector, yet social care is an easy way to find work in other countries, so, creating a certificate demonstrating a worker knew the agreed basics in care would aid worker mobility, assist employability and promote better standards. Our research found that induction training often did not routinely happen (or even exist), that the front line staff were badly trained but still asked to make complex judgments.\n\nThis innovation has proved very sucessful, with over 3650 candidates so far in our ECC database. Employers and workers quickly understand what it demonstrates and trainers like the ‘learning outcomes’ which links to the EQF approach. EASPD promotes high standards of care built around the value base encapsulated in the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. The ECC provides a practical way of delivering that across the whole of Europe."

This project represents a social innovation as it fills in a gap in the service provision by starting before the classic debt reliefservices foreseen in the Netherlands and concretely addressing a new need emerged in society as consequence of the economic crisis (and of the increasing necessity of making choices in a liberalized economy: pensions, insurances, utilities etc). The project aims at preventing social poverty and social exclusion. In addition, it contributes to the empowerment of users improving their skills and abilities as well as promoting their active inclusion and (re)integration in society.\n\nThe support given by volunteers is mostly short term and it is adapted according to the specific needs of the users. Examples of users are: people experiencing financial troubles (i.e. as consequence of bankrupt, indebtedness or displacement); young adults having difficulties with financial management (i.e.as consequence of illiteracy or low level of education); ex-prisoners needing administrative support to reintegrate into society. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this service and its impact on people’s life, Humanitas commissioned an in-depth research to the University of Tilburg. This innovative method of evaluation represents a source of evidence-based information which can be used to better allocate resources in the future development and implementation of Humanitas projects.\n\nBeing part of this programme, users acquire new financial skills and abilities and learn (step by step) how to independently manage their administrative work. This program offers them a concrete help to overcome existing financial troubles and to prevent problems to become more serious. The findings of the research carried out by the University of Tilburg show that the high quality of support received is one of the most important sources of satisfaction of the users of this programme. Users indicate to have experienced activating incentives and a safe space to exercise with new/renewed skills.\n\nLearning new skills and acquiring new abilities as well as establishing a personal relation with the volunteer, users improve their self-confidence and independency. Based on the value of solidarity and independence, the support offered by volunteers is more than merely ‘administrative’ and contributes to the empowerment of the user and her/his (re)integration in society."

The child centre offers early education, parent—children play sessions, health and family support, etc. Simultaneously the municipality began the Szociális Földprogram (Social Land Programme), which targeted families in need and used the child centre as a means to draw attention to the programme and raise interests among the attending families.\n\nThe latter program is intended to increase economic activities by promoting agricultural activities and ensuring all necessary conditions for the practise. The main purpose was to inspire and activate people, to influence the perception of children on the values of working and provide positive examples. The municipality succeeded to further intertwine the two projects as the involved families can meet, discuss and give pieces of advice to each other in the child centre.\n\nIn 2011 a new programme was set off devoted to facilitate transit employment for longterm unemployed in micro-region of Bácska. The re-qualification courses aimed at community service type jobs, therefore they corresponded with the labour force demands of municipalities – mostly concerning building industry, maintenance and gardening. In each municipality there is one mentor who is responsible to help the re-qualified employees. Another project aiming to increase employment and create a self-sustaining community offers courses on cultivation and stock raising. The municipality plans to establish a Social Shop and a counselling centre to facilitate the sale of the products. The mentioned child centre ensures child-care while parents are working. Recently in January 2012 an integration project was inaugurated targeting families facing multiple disadvantages.\n\nThe programme incorporates counselling services to improve life leadership and learning competences. The main purpose is to increase solidarity and enhance cooperation and mutual help within the community.\n\nThe municipality successfully integrated the projects to cope with the challenges of poverty and unemployment. Unfortunately, Katymár can be considered rather as an exceptional municipality and their approach tends to be rare in Hungary."

It is a network of associations with eight childcare centers, in Paris and French cities such as Arles and Nimes. These centers adapt to the incomes and work schedules of disadvantaged families and ensure a diverse mix of social strata. The ideas underlying the philosophy of the Môm’artre network are:\n\n• Opening childcare centers with schedules adapted to urban environments (open until 8 pm, for instance), primarily to accommodate low-income families and single parents.\n\n• Offering a variable fee structure depending on the family's income (from 10cts/h to a maximum of 8€/h).\n\n• Proposing a full-service offer focused on children's fulfillment after school. (Organization of after-school snacks, homework and artistic activities, neighborhood events and gatherings on weekends).\n\n• Employing struggling artists to create jobs and provide access to art and culture.\n\n• Developing job training for parents in difficulty.\n\n• Providing equal employment opportunities and jobs for women.\n\nObserving that many families cannot find appropriate after-school childcare, they set up the first Môm’artre associations in response to the problems so many households encounter. In urban environments, it is impossible for reconcile family life with professional obligations without sacrificing part of one or the other. The goal is to provide solutions adapted to transportation problems, working hours and budget constraints for different types of families. The innovation in the network is especially in providing an active response to a social need either not provided or badly met.\n\nThe overall approach is based on four priorities:\n\n• Initiation to art\n\n• School and learning support\n\n• Support for parents in difficulty\n\n• Assistance in social integration\n\n\n\nThe project can extend to all large urban centers in France and Europe. The economic model combines the participation of citizens, local municipalities and commercial companies. This way, they provide a modern, solidarity-based social service. The actions and activities provide effective answers to the lack of affordable and appropriate after-school care, especially for low-income and/or single-parent families living in the city. The incompatibility between working hours and school hours is an obstacle to finding lasting employment. This often makes families in this situation even more vulnerable. The scholastic and social integration of children is also closely related to poor 'after-school' frameworks, and to the lack of cultural exposure for children of families in difficulty."

The organization has furthermore realized a strategy that allows for including and illustrating the perspective even of people that have difficulties in communicating their opinion (due to their age or physical or mental impairments). The quality evaluation is thus highly inclusive and empowers users and clients in unprecedented degrees.\n\nThereby the organization offers a service that complements potentially existing internal quality management systems.

The constitution of a foundation was evaluated as the best organisational solution to make the social action more flexible and articulated.\n\nThe Foundation operates in the big city of Milan and has been realizing a project called 'Residential' through a partnership between private sector, Lombardy Region and the Department of Mental Health of the Ospedale Fatebenefratelli of Milan. The goal was to answer properly to the strong request for assistance among patients and relatives. The project began in 2008 with a duration of 3 years, Fondazione Aiutiamoli is the leader actor, beside two historic local volunteer associations (Cascina Verde Spes and Diversamente Onlus), supporting the management, logistics, monitoring and economic feasibility of the project.\n\nThanks to this synergy it is possible to offer a vital turning point for people who need and desire to learn, develop and design their autonomy and social reintegration. The project requires a close relationship with local mental health centers (CPS), it is intended for 14 people who have already completed a rehabilitation program and are able to take a new path of autonomy and social integration, starting from living in a private house. Users, groups of three to five people, experience the daily life together, share resources and opportunities, with professional support, in collaboration with community services."

The primary objective is to set up synergies among different health or wellness skills and giving beneficiaries the role of fully-involved actors. The targeted activity concerns 'self esteem' using theatre as a vector, led by an actress trained in 'non-violent' communication and in the Theatre of the  Oppressed (Forum Theatre).\n\nEach year in the territory a 'Faites de la Santé' (a sort of 'well-being' festival) is held, to communicate on the actions conducted over the year, and to discuss a cross-sector issue. In 2007, the proposed topic was self esteem (an integral part of the project). After several sessions, some inhabitants expressed their wish to continue the process and asked us to set up a long-term activity to support expression and mutual understanding. The active network helped us to call in a professional actress to lead the group and about ten inhabitants as members of the workshop.\n\nThe innovation is that the inhabitants themselves run the workshop. An actress is there to facilitate dialog. She uses the stage as a free expression platform. The theatre work centers around the problems and issues proposed by the inhabitants (linked to wellness topics). Because of this, it is very much appreciated by the local public. Self esteem is a central theme in the approach to good health. It reflects the wish of the inhabitants to be involved in health issues, and they cannot imagine an approach to community well-being without working on self esteem. This work also helps to develop psycho-social skills as defined by the W.H.O.: 'Learning to solve problems, make decisions, develop creative thinking, critical thinking, effective communication, human relations skills, to be self-aware and have empathy for others, and to manage your own stress in order to deal with emotions'."
